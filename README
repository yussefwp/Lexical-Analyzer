All tasks 2.1 to 2.6 are done and works properly. you can check my js code.
I have answerd each task and put the question as comments to make it easy to
grade my code. 
I also created an html file that pop up to ask for your input and gives an 
input example like "mul 5 sub 2 sum 7 2 9"

Everything works good just load the html file "lexer.html" and you can check the js codes too.
